//! SD-card persistence — mount, atomic save, crash recovery.
//!
//! The editor's notes live at `/sd/repo/notes.md` on a FAT filesystem on the
//! microSD card. This module owns bringing that card up and reading/writing the
//! buffer safely across power loss. It is the graduation of the Spike 3 bench
//! binary (`src/bin/sd_fat.rs`): that spike proved the raw stack on hardware
//! (verified 2026-07-11); the proven bits now live here so the editor and the
//! spike share one implementation instead of the spike being a dead-end proof.
//!
//! ## Storage split (ADR-007)
//!
//! FAT-on-SD holds the git working copy (`/sd/repo/`) and local scratch
//! (`/sd/local/`); device config is compiled into the binary in v0.1. The repo
//! is provisioned host-side (`just init` / `just load` copy a clone onto the
//! card) and opened — not cloned — on device, so this module never creates the
//! repo directory: a missing `/sd/repo` means the card wasn't provisioned, which
//! the boot path surfaces as a fatal "re-run `just init`" rather than silently
//! papering over.
//!
//! ## Dedicated SPI3 bus (ADR-012)
//!
//! The card sits on its own SPI3 host (SCK 14, MOSI 15, MISO 13, CS 10). The EPD
//! keeps SPI2. The EPD driver holds an exclusive `spi_device_acquire_bus` lock
//! for its whole lifetime, so a shared bus would lock the SD out; giving the SD
//! its own host sidesteps that for ~2 GPIOs. See the `mount` docs and ADR-012.
//!
//! ## Atomic save + crash recovery (the load-bearing part)
//!
//! FAT gives weak power-loss guarantees, so a save is: write `notes.md.tmp`,
//! `fsync`, unlink the target, rename the tmp over it. On FAT that unlink is
//! mandatory — FatFS's `f_rename` returns `FR_EXIST` on an existing destination
//! (it does *not* replace like POSIX `rename(2)`; Spike 3 finding). That unlink
//! opens a small window where the target is gone while the complete new content
//! sits in the tmp. [`Storage::recover`] closes the loop at boot — see its docs
//! for the exact case analysis, which is subtler than "promote the tmp."
