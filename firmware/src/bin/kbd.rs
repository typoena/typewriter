//! Keyboard smoke test — USB host boot keyboard, nothing else.
//!
//! The lightest possible "does the keyboard work on this board?" check: it
//! brings up the shared [`firmware::drivers::keyboard_usb`] host stack and echoes every
//! decoded key to the serial console. No SD card, no e-paper, no Wi-Fi — so it
//! runs on a bare ESP32-S3 with only a USB keyboard plugged into the OTG port
//! (the editor firmware `boot_halt`s on a missing card long before the keyboard
//! ever starts, which is exactly what this bin sidesteps).
//!
//! It links no libgit2 and uses the default single-app partition table, so
//! `just flash-kbd` builds and flashes fast. Type on the attached keyboard and
//! watch the `keyboard: …` lines on the monitor; the running `line` shows
//! printable characters accumulating so you can confirm the full US-QWERTY +
//! dead-key accent path, not just that reports arrive.
