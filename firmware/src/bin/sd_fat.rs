//! Spike 3 — SD card (FAT) on its own SPI3 host, now a thin on-device harness
//! over the real [`firmware::persistence`] module.
//!
//! The raw storage stack (SPI3 bring-up, hand-rolled SDSPI descriptors, the
//! atomic write/fsync/unlink/rename dance) was proven here first and has since
//! graduated into `firmware::persistence` so the editor and this spike share one
//! implementation. This binary now just drives that module on hardware:
//!
//!   1. [`Storage::mount`] — SPI3 (SCK 14, MOSI 15, MISO 13, CS 10; ADR-012) +
//!      FAT mount at `/sd` + boot crash-recovery. `format_if_mount_failed` is
//!      false in the module, so the card must already be FAT-formatted (it is —
//!      Spike 3 formatted it 2026-07-11).
//!   2. Report the card's negotiated clock and FAT usage.
//!   3. Load `/sd/repo/notes.md` (non-destructive) and report its size.
//!   4. Only if there is no notes.md yet (a blank bench card, nothing to lose)
//!      exercise the real [`Storage::save`] → [`Storage::load`] round-trip and
//!      byte-compare. On a provisioned card the write test is skipped so the
//!      user's writing is never clobbered by the bench tool.
//!
//! Flash with `just flash-sd`. Needs no `.env`.
