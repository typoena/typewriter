//! On-device git publish — the transport behind the editor's `:sync`.
//!
//! Graduated from the `src/bin/git_sync.rs` spike (milestone #2A, hardware-
//! verified 2026-07-07). The spike proved `open` + fast-forward `push` over
//! mbedTLS HTTPS+PAT against a persistent clone; this module lifts that logic
//! into a service the editor drives, with three changes for the product:
//!
//! 1. **Storage is the SD card `/sd/repo`** (the same working copy the editor
//!    saves `notes.md` into via [`crate::persistence`]), not the spike's 4 MB
//!    flash-FAT `/spiflash/repo`. The real notes repo can't fit in flash, so the
//!    card is the only viable home — and there's a single source of truth: git
//!    commits the exact file the editor just wrote. The git thread reaches the
//!    card through plain `std::fs`; FatFS's per-volume reentrancy lock serialises
//!    it against the UI task's saves (see [`crate::persistence::Storage`]).
//! 2. **`open` only — never clone-and-wipe.** The spike re-cloned into a
//!    throwaway flash dir; doing that to the user's card would delete their
//!    notes. A `/sd/repo` that isn't a valid repo is a provisioning error
//!    (`just init`), surfaced as such, not papered over.
//! 3. **No synthetic content.** The spike appended a marker line; here the
//!    editor has already saved the user's buffers before `:sync` signals us,
//!    so we just commit + push what's on disk.
//! 4. **The commit is an O(depth) TreeBuilder splice, not an index pass.**
//!    The request carries the repo-relative paths saved/deleted since the last
//!    confirmed publish (`Storage`'s journaled dirty set); `stage_and_commit`
//!    patches exactly those onto HEAD's tree. The index pipeline it replaced
//!    (`add_all` → `index.write` → `write_tree`) is O(N_tree) and measured up
//!    to 611 s on the real 1179-file / 570 MB-pack clone — see
//!    docs/tradeoff-curves/sync-commit-staging.md for the whole trail.
//!
//! Runs on a dedicated 96 KB thread (libgit2's init→push chain nests ~67 KB of
//! `GIT_PATH_MAX` stack buffers — see git_push.rs / postmortem #3). Config is
//! baked at build time (`TW_*`, ADR-007: v0.1 device config is compiled in).
