# Typoena firmware

Rust crate targeting `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf`. See the project root
[`README.md`](../README.md) and
[`docs/v0.1-mvp-technical.md`](../docs/v0.1-mvp-technical.md) for the wider
context.

## Current state

**Modal editor (vim modes) — modes verified 2026-07-05.** The firmware is now a
small vim-style modal text editor. [`src/editor.rs`](src/editor.rs) owns the
buffer, caret, motions, and per-mode rendering; [`src/main.rs`](src/main.rs) is
the hardware loop that drains keystrokes, redraws, and picks a refresh strategy;
[`src/usb_kbd.rs`](src/usb_kbd.rs) decodes editing chords and a dual-role Caps
key. The buffer is pure ASCII, so a byte offset doubles as the caret's character
index (Tab expands to spaces on insert).

Modes (shown live in a small status strip below the text):

- **Insert** — the boot mode; keys type at the caret. `Ctrl+W` /
  `Ctrl+Backspace` delete the previous word, `Cmd+Backspace` deletes to the
  start of the line.
- **Normal** — motions `h j k l`, `w b e`, `0` `$`, `gg` `G`; edits `x`, `dd`,
  and the `d` / `c` (change) operators over motions and text objects — `ciw`,
  `daw`, `di(`, `ci"`, … (bracket pairs are nesting-aware); `i a A I o O` to
  enter insert; count prefixes like `3j`, `2dd`.
- **View** — read-only reading: `j` / `k` scroll, `space` pages, `gg` / `G`
  jump; edits are locked out.

**Caps Lock is dual-role**: tapped it is `Esc` (→ Normal); held it is `Ctrl`.
So Caps no longer types capitals — use Shift.

Rendering reuses the partial refresh from Spike 5: additive Insert typing stays
on the fast windowed path with a ~750 ms debounced caret, while caret moves,
deletes, mode switches, and View scrolling take a clean full-area partial
(~630 ms). Count prefixes collapse repeated motion into a single refresh, which
matters at this latency.

Known rough edges (deferred): no backspace auto-repeat (the keyboard is on
`SET_IDLE(0)` and only key-downs are tracked), non-sticky column on `j` / `k`,
the `$` / end-of-line block caret sits one cell past the last char, `iw` / `aw`
are whitespace-delimited (like vim's `iW` / `aW`), and `cw` isn't special-cased
to `ce`.

**Spike 5 — partial refresh + typing: verified 2026-07-04.** `main.rs` wires
the keyboard to the panel: [`src/usb_kbd.rs`](src/usb_kbd.rs) feeds decoded
key-downs (US layout, edge-detected) into a queue, and the main loop keeps a
wrapped, scrolling text buffer that it draws with a **partial refresh**
(`Epd::display_frame_partial`) per keystroke batch, plus a periodic full
refresh to clear ghosting. First spike where input and output run together.
Measured on the bench at 4 MHz SPI: partial refresh ~630 ms, full ~1870 ms —
the partial waveform (~490 ms, all 272 rows) dominates. Follow-up: windowed-Y
partial refresh (drive only the edited line's rows) to cut per-keystroke
latency.

**Spike 4 — USB host keyboard: verified 2026-07-04.**
[`src/usb_kbd.rs`](src/usb_kbd.rs) drives the ESP-IDF USB Host Library directly
through the raw `esp-idf-sys` bindings (no managed HID class driver), enumerates
an attached keyboard, claims the boot-keyboard interface, switches it to boot
protocol, and polls the interrupt-IN endpoint — decoding each 8-byte report into
modifiers + keycodes. Verified with a `19f5:3255` keyboard: keystrokes,
modifiers, and rollover all decode correctly.

Hardware: flash + serial over the CP2102 "UART" port (console = UART0,
independent of the USB PHY), keyboard on the native "USB" port. The keyboard
enumerated **bus-powered** — no external VBUS injection needed on this
DevKitC-1 v1.0 (keep a 5 V power cable only as a brownout fallback for
higher-power/RGB devices).

**Spike 2 — EPD: verified 2026-07-04.** The GDEY0579T93 e-paper panel is
driven through the thin dual-SSD1683 driver in [`src/epd.rs`](src/epd.rs)
(ported from GxEPD2's `GxEPD2_579_GDEY0579T93`). Verified on the bench rig over
4 MHz SPI:

- **2a — uniform fill:** clean full-panel white ↔ black refreshes, proving
  the wiring, both cascaded controllers, RAM addressing, and the full
  refresh waveform.
- **2b — graphics/text:** `epd::Frame` implements `embedded-graphics`'
  `DrawTarget`; a stroked circle straddling the master/slave seam (x = 396)
  renders round and continuous, and `FONT_10X20` text is legible — proving
  the split-and-mirror full-frame blit (`Epd::display_frame`).

Wiring: SCK 12 · DIN/MOSI 11 · CS 7 · DC 6 · RST 5 · BUSY 4, via the
DESPI-C579 breakout.

Every build is stamped by [`build.rs`](build.rs) with UTC time and
`git describe --always --dirty`; the tag is logged on serial at boot and
drawn on the panel, so the running build is always identifiable during
diagnosis.

Bring-up note: the initial symptom was per-pixel noise on the panel — a
half-seated CS jumper, not firmware. If the panel shows speckle/banding,
reseat the jumpers (CS first) before debugging code.

[`docs/v0.1-mvp-technical.md`](../docs/v0.1-mvp-technical.md#hardware-bring-up-order):
Wi-Fi/TLS, gitoxide push; SD is deferred.

**Spike 1 — Blink: verified 2026-07-04.** GPIO 2 + on-board WS2812 toggled
at 1 Hz with `blink N` on USB-serial, proving toolchain, esp-idf link, and
GPIO on real silicon. The blink code was replaced by Spike 2 in `main.rs`
(see git history: `e040a8d`).

## Quick commands

A [`justfile`](https://github.com/casey/just) wraps the common commands and
sources the espup env itself — run `just` in this directory for the list
(`build`, `flash`, `monitor`, `info`, `ports`).

## Build

Once per shell session, source the espup env (sets `LIBCLANG_PATH` and adds
the Xtensa GCC to `PATH`):

```sh
. ~/export-esp.sh
```

Then from this directory:

```sh
cargo build --release
```

The first build is slow (the esp-idf C sources are checked out and built
under `.embuild/`). Subsequent builds are incremental.

## Flash (when hardware is on the bench)

`cargo run --release` triggers `espflash flash --monitor` via the runner
configured in `.cargo/config.toml`. With the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 connected
over USB you should see:

```
[…] blink 0
[…] blink 1
[…] blink 2
…
```

at 1 Hz on the serial monitor, and — if an LED is wired from GPIO 2 → 330 Ω
→ GND — the LED blinks in lockstep.

## Pin choice

GPIO 2 is a safe general-purpose pin on the ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1: it's not
tied to a strapping function at boot and not muxed to the USB or PSRAM
peripherals. The blink loop also drives the on-board addressable LED —
WS2812 on GPIO 48 (GPIO 38 on DevKitC-1 v1.1 boards) — via the RMT
peripheral, so both a plain GPIO and the RMT path are exercised.

## Board pinout

The bench board follows the **ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 v1.0** pinout — an
ESP32-S3-WROOM-1 **N16R8** module (16 MB flash, 8 MB octal PSRAM). The v1.0
revision wires the on-board WS2812 RGB LED to **GPIO 48**; v1.1 moved it to
GPIO 38, so match assignments against this diagram, not the v1.1 one.

Source: [Espressif ESP32-S3-DevKitC-1 v1.0 user guide][devkitc-1-v1.0]. The
octal PSRAM consumes **GPIO 26–37**, so those are unavailable for peripherals.

## Editor / rust-analyzer

The repo-level `.zed/settings.json` configures `rust-analyzer` for this
crate:

- `cargo.target` is pinned to `xtensa-esp32s3-espidf` with
  `allTargets = false`, so RA doesn't try to also check the crate for the
  host target (which can't build `esp-idf-sys`).
- `binary.path` is pinned to the **rustup-managed** rust-analyzer
  (`stable` toolchain), not Zed's bundled one. Reason: recent Zed builds
  ship a rust-analyzer that calls `cargo metadata --lockfile-path`, which
  is still gated behind `-Z unstable-options` in cargo 1.95 and fails on
  both the `stable` and `esp` toolchains. The rustup-managed RA is
  version-locked to the cargo it ships with and avoids the flag.

If a contributor on a different machine has issues, regenerate the path:

```sh
rustup component add rust-analyzer --toolchain stable
rustup which rust-analyzer --toolchain stable
# put the printed path into .zed/settings.json under lsp.rust-analyzer.binary.path
```

Two things rust-analyzer still needs from the **environment Zed was
launched in**:

- `LIBCLANG_PATH` — required by `bindgen` inside `esp-idf-sys`.
- The Xtensa GCC on `PATH` — required by `embuild` during `cargo check`.

Both are set by `~/export-esp.sh`. The pragmatic workflow:

```sh
. ~/export-esp.sh
zed /Users/julien/jclab/typewriter   # or: open from this shell
```

If Zed is launched from Finder/Dock instead, rust-analyzer will report
`bindgen` errors on the first `esp-idf-sys` check. Close Zed, source the
env in a terminal, and relaunch from there.

## Toolchain pins

`rust-toolchain.toml` pins the channel to `esp` (installed by `espup
install`). Cargo.toml currently includes git `[patch.crates-io]` overrides
for `esp-idf-sys` / `esp-idf-hal` / `esp-idf-svc` (template default). These
follow master and may need pinning to released versions if a master commit
breaks the build.
