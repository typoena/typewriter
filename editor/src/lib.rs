//! Modal text editor core: a vim-style buffer with Normal / Insert (edit) /
//! Visual (selection) / View (read-only) modes, rendered onto the e-paper
//! [`Frame`].
//!
//! The buffer is a UTF-8 `String` (the keyboard's dead-key composer feeds it
//! accented Latin-9 characters). `caret` is a byte offset that always sits on a
//! char boundary: motions and edits step whole characters via `next_char` /
//! `prev_char`, and display columns are character counts, so a two-byte `é`
//! never traps the caret mid-character. Motions and edits work on the logical
//! (`\n`-delimited) buffer; word-wrapping and scrolling are a render-time
//! concern handled by [`Editor::draw`].

// ISO-8859-15 (Latin-9) rather than the ascii subset: same glyph cells, but it
// carries the accented Latin glyphs (à é ê ç … plus œ €) that international
// input will emit. ASCII rendering is byte-for-byte unchanged.
