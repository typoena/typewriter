# Typoena

A distraction-free, hackable, DIY writing machine. ESP32-S3 + e-ink + a real
mechanical keyboard. You write Markdown, you commit, you push. Nothing else
runs on it.

> **Status: v0.7 shipped, hardware on bench.** v0.1 (MVP — boots, edits,

> file palette + multi-buffer, Markdown affordances, `/` search, `:gp` push /
> `:gl` pull) followed within the week. Firmware is at 0.7.0; next up is v0.8

## Vision

A single-purpose appliance that boots into a text editor with a Vim keymap,
edits Markdown files, and (optionally) pushes them to a git remote (GitHub
first) over Wi-Fi. No browser, no notifications, no apps. Open lid → write →
push (or don't) → close lid.

Two file scopes coexist on the SD card — formal definitions in
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md):

- **Tracked** — lives in the git working copy, gets **Pushed** when the
  user runs `:gp`.
- **Local** — never leaves the device. Permanently-private: journal entries,
  scratch, things that aren't anyone else's business. There is no "promote
  to Tracked" gesture — scope is fixed at file creation.

Same editor, same keymap; the difference is just whether `:gp` (push to
the remote) is offered.

## Hardware

**ESP32-S3-N16R8** (16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM) · **GDEY0579T93** 5.79″ e-ink
strip (792×272, ~2.9:1 — biases the UX toward "current line + recent context",
the writing posture we want) · **Nuphy wired USB keyboard** with the S3 as USB
host · **microSD over SPI** · **USB-C wall power** for the MVP, battery in
v0.8.

Complete bill of materials with part references: [`docs/bom.md`](docs/bom.md).
Part rationale and bench status:
[`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md). Enclosure — a parametric,
3D-printable typewriter-body case (OpenSCAD): [`hardware/case/`](hardware/case/README.md).

## Software stack

**Language: Rust on `esp-idf-rs` (std).** Every stack decision — language, UI
strategy, display, git lib, auth, concurrency, storage, power, keyboard
transport — has an ADR in [`docs/adr.md`](docs/adr.md), including the rejected
alternatives (Ratatui, Gleam + Shore on AtomVM, C/Arduino — ADR-001/002). How
each decision is weighted against the user-facing requirements lives in
[`docs/qfd.md`](docs/qfd.md); the ontology those docs use is defined in
[`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md). Where a default traces to a cost curve rather than
a discrete pick — energy, latency, or memory bending against an interval or size
— the curve and its knee live in
[`docs/tradeoff-curves/README.md`](docs/tradeoff-curves/README.md). A
memory-safety review of the Rust `unsafe`/FFI
surface (mostly `usb_kbd.rs`) is in [`MEMORY_AUDIT.md`](MEMORY_AUDIT.md).

## UX boundaries set by the medium

E-ink is a brutal honesty filter on UI choices. Hard constraints we design
around, not against:

- **No cursor blink.** Kills the panel and the battery.
- **Typing latency target: ≤ 200 ms** from keypress to glyph on screen, using
  partial refresh on the affected line only.
- **Full refresh every ~20 partials** to clear ghosting. User-visible flash —
  schedule it on pauses (>1 s of no input).
- **No smooth scrolling.** Page-style jumps only.
- **No animations.** Anywhere.
- **Render only changed lines**, not the viewport.

---

## Roadmap

Releases are frequent, and every version is a usable artifact rather than a
checkpoint. Per-version scope, current `[x]`/`[~]` marks, and the Macroplan
source live in [`docs/macroplan.md`](docs/macroplan.md).

/hardware                 enclosure — parametric OpenSCAD case (case/) + renders

                          the principles that fall out of them
GLOSSARY.md               methodology glossary — the WHAT / Function /

## Open questions / risks (tracked, not yet resolved)

- [ ] Heap fragmentation over a long writing session with the PSRAM allocator.
- [ ] Real-world e-ink ghosting with the current partial-refresh cadence.
- [~] Use-after-free freeing the in-flight USB transfer on keyboard unplug —
  fixed in code, pending an on-device hot-plug run to confirm
  ([`MEMORY_AUDIT.md`](MEMORY_AUDIT.md) finding #1).

Retired risks ([gix push](docs/postmortems/2026-07-05-spike7-gix-https-push.md),
[SD CMD59 rejection](docs/postmortems/2026-07-05-spike3-sd-cmd59.md), TinyUSB HID
stability, TLS heap, libgit2-on-xtensa) and how they died:
[`docs/spikes.md`](docs/spikes.md) and
[`docs/postmortems/`](docs/postmortems/README.md).

These get resolved by writing code, not by deciding harder.
