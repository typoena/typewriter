# Typoena

A distraction-free, hackable, DIY writing machine. ESP32-S3 + e-ink + a real
mechanical keyboard. You write Markdown, you commit, you push. Nothing else
runs on it.

> **Status: pre-MVP, hardware on bench.** Display, USB keyboard, live typing
> with partial refresh, Wi-Fi + TLS, SD storage, and on-device git push are all
> verified in spikes; SD mount and save are now wired into the app binary. No
> release has shipped yet — v0.1's remaining gate is the boot splash and wiring
> git publish (`Ctrl-G` → push) into the app binary. Live per-item status:
> [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md) · failure write-ups:
> [`docs/postmortems/`](docs/postmortems/README.md).

## Vision

A single-purpose appliance that boots into a text editor with a Vim keymap,
edits Markdown files, and (optionally) pushes them to a git remote (GitHub
first) over Wi-Fi. No browser, no notifications, no apps. Open lid → write →
push (or don't) → close lid.

Two file scopes coexist on the SD card — formal definitions in
[`CONTEXT.md`](CONTEXT.md):

- **Tracked** — lives in the git working copy, gets **Published** when the
  user presses `Ctrl-G`.
- **Local** — never leaves the device. Permanently-private: journal entries,
  scratch, things that aren't anyone else's business. There is no "promote
  to Tracked" gesture — scope is fixed at file creation.

Same editor, same keymap; the difference is just whether `Ctrl-G` (publish to
the remote) is offered.

## Hardware

**ESP32-S3-N16R8** (16 MB flash, 8 MB PSRAM) · **GDEY0579T93** 5.79″ e-ink
strip (792×272, ~2.9:1 — biases the UX toward "current line + recent context",
the writing posture we want) · **Nuphy wired USB keyboard** with the S3 as USB
host · **microSD over SPI** · **USB-C wall power** for the MVP, battery in
v0.8.

Full part table, rationale, and bench status:
[`docs/hardware.md`](docs/hardware.md). Enclosure — a parametric,
3D-printable typewriter-body case (OpenSCAD): [`hardware/case/`](hardware/case/README.md).

## Software stack

**Language: Rust on `esp-idf-rs` (std).** Every stack decision — language, UI
strategy, display, git lib, auth, concurrency, storage, power, keyboard
transport — has an ADR in [`docs/adr.md`](docs/adr.md), including the rejected
alternatives (Ratatui, Gleam + Shore on AtomVM, C/Arduino — ADR-001/002). How
each decision is weighted against the user-facing requirements lives in
[`docs/qfd.md`](docs/qfd.md); the ontology those docs use is defined in
[`GLOSSARY.md`](GLOSSARY.md). A memory-safety review of the Rust `unsafe`/FFI
surface (mostly `usb_kbd.rs`) is in [`MEMORY_AUDIT.md`](MEMORY_AUDIT.md).

## UX boundaries set by the medium

E-ink is a brutal honesty filter on UI choices. Hard constraints we design
around, not against:

- **No cursor blink.** Kills the panel and the battery.
- **Typing latency target: ≤ 200 ms** from keypress to glyph on screen, using
  partial refresh on the affected line only.
- **Full refresh every ~20 partials** to clear ghosting. User-visible flash —
  schedule it on pauses (>1 s of no input).
- **No smooth scrolling.** Page-style jumps only.
- **No animations.** Anywhere.
- **Render only changed lines**, not the viewport.

## Roadmap

Releases are frequent, and every version is a usable artifact rather than a
checkpoint. Per-version scope, current `[x]`/`[~]` marks, and the Macroplan
source live in [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

## Repo layout

```
/firmware                 Rust crate, esp-idf-rs target
                          (SD card mounted at runtime contains /repo and /local)
  /src
    main.rs               app binary — editor + display + USB (SD/git not wired yet)
    editor.rs             modal editor core: buffer, modes, keymap, :commands
    epd.rs                SSD1683 dual-controller e-ink driver
    usb_kbd.rs            TinyUSB host glue, HID → key events
    /bin                  on-device spike binaries (sd_fat, wifi_tls, git_push,
                          git_sync, git_smoke)
  /components/libgit2     libgit2 as an esp-idf CMake component (mbedTLS);
                          source vendored as a git submodule
  build.rs                bakes TW_* env vars (Wi-Fi, PAT, author) — v0.1 config path
/spikes                   desktop spikes (spike7 git push proof, pre-device)
/docs                     ADRs, QFD, hardware, roadmap, per-version specs,
                          spikes.md, postmortems/, notes/
/hardware                 enclosure — parametric OpenSCAD case (case/) + renders
CONTEXT.md                project glossary — Tracked / Local / Save / Publish, and
                          the principles that fall out of them
GLOSSARY.md               methodology glossary — the WHAT / Function /
                          Characteristic / Metric / Target ontology layers
package.json              pnpm + oxfmt — formatting toolchain for docs/JSON

## Open questions / risks (tracked, not yet resolved)

- [ ] Heap fragmentation over a long writing session with the PSRAM allocator.
- [ ] Real-world e-ink ghosting with the current partial-refresh cadence.
- [~] Use-after-free freeing the in-flight USB transfer on keyboard unplug —
  fixed in code, pending an on-device hot-plug run to confirm
  ([`MEMORY_AUDIT.md`](MEMORY_AUDIT.md) finding #1).

Retired risks ([gix push](docs/postmortems/2026-07-05-spike7-gix-https-push.md),
[SD CMD59 rejection](docs/postmortems/2026-07-05-spike3-sd-cmd59.md), TinyUSB HID
stability, TLS heap, libgit2-on-xtensa) and how they died:
[`docs/spikes.md`](docs/spikes.md) and
[`docs/postmortems/`](docs/postmortems/README.md).

These get resolved by writing code, not by deciding harder.
