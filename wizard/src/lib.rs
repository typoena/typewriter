//! On-device onboarding wizard — the step/field state machine.
//!
//! Spec: docs/v0.9-onboarding-wizard.md. The wizard runs *instead of* the
//! editor when the card is unconfigured (no usable `typoena.conf` **or** no
//! `/sd/repo` — the second half makes a power-pull between "conf written" and
//! "clone finished" resume here rather than hit the no-repo boot halt).
//!
//! Same architecture as the editor crate: this is pure logic, host-testable.
//! Keys (`keymap::Key`) come in via [`Wizard::key`], I/O requests come out as
//! [`Effect`]s that the firmware driver executes (join Wi-Fi, run the GitHub
//! device flow, list repos, clone), and the driver feeds results back via
//! [`Wizard::event`]. Rendering is [`Wizard::draw_into`] onto a
//! `display::Frame`, the `show_message` pattern — no editor loop involved.
//!
//! Steps: Wi-Fi → Sign in (device-flow QR) → Repo pick → Clone → Done. Every
//! completed step hands the driver a [`Effect::WriteConf`] so progress
//! persists atomically (unlink + tmp + rename) and a power-pull resumes at
//! the right step.
