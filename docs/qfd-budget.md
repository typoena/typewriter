# 6. Critical performance budget

A curated rank, drawing from [§3 importance](qfd-house-1.md#3-house-of-quality--whats--hows) and [§4 conflicts](qfd-house-1.md#4-roof--how-vs-how-tradeoffs), with one
deliberate override: acceptance-criteria critical paths (H4 boot,
H5 soak) move up regardless of weighted-vote spread. (Pre-W14 this list
also lifted H8 durability over its narrow voter base; W14 has widened
that base, so H8's top-five spot is now arithmetic; see [§3](qfd-house-1.md#3-house-of-quality--whats--hows).) These started as
the numbers spikes 2–7 had to validate; most are now measured on the
shipped device. The Verdict column carries the result, and every row
names its fallback in "If we miss it": a target without a fallback is a
wish, not a budget. The fallback column also covers regression on
already-met targets.

The two not-in-MVP rows but already-shaped-by-design:

| — | H13 current | Measured only in v0.1 | bench multimeter | Cell sizing for v0.8 is data-driven, not spec-sheet | If measurements say > 2-day life is unreachable: revisit [ADR-008]'s cell class or W11's weight, on numbers, not hope |
| — | H11 stacks | Sum ≤ 128 KB (was ≤ 80 KB) | measured: 124 KB explicit (git 96 + walk 16 + USB 4+8) | Target followed the shipped architecture; [§2 ∥](qfd-house-1.md#2-engineering-characteristics-the-hows) | Re-price before adding any thread; if a new one breaks the sum, shrink or merge an existing stack first |
