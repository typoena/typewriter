## The model

`:sync` commits the working tree on the SD/FAT card before it pushes. The commit
is two kinds of work against the card over SPI (10 MHz today, ADR-012):

```
  stage                                 write
  ───────────────────────────────       ─────────────────────────────
  add_all(["*"]) + update_all(["*"])     index.write + write_tree + commit-obj
  → stat() every file in the tree,       → serialise the index and three loose
    hash the ones whose stat moved          objects, each a FAT create+write+fsync
  cost ∝ tree size  (O(N_tree))          cost ∝ churn (O(N_changed)) + fixed
```

The two have different curves against **N = files in `/sd/repo`**:

- **Walk** rises with N. `add_all(["*"])` visits the whole working tree every
  sync regardless of how little changed, and each visit is a FAT `stat` (and a
  re-hash when the entry looks dirty) over SPI. This is the term explicit-path
  staging removes: the editor already knows which buffers are dirty and which
  were `:delete`d, so `index.add_path(p)` / `index.remove_path(p)` over that set
  touches `N_changed` files (≈1 for a writing appliance), not `N`.
- **Write** is flat in N. A text commit is the index + a blob + a tree + a commit
  object — a handful of small FAT writes whose cost is set by SPI clock and
  `fsync`, not by tree size. Explicit-path staging cannot shave this; only a
  faster card bus (SD 10 → 20 MHz on a clean PCB, `persistence.rs`) does.

```

```

The gap between the lines at a given N is exactly what switching buys, and it
**grows without bound** as the notes tree fills.

### The real operating point (measured 2026-07-12, `jcalixte/notes`)

The device syncs into a clone of the actual notes repo, not a `notes.md` toy. Its
working tree is **not small**:

| | count | working-tree bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Markdown (`.md`) | 875 | ~1.5 MB |
| Images (png/jpg/webp/bmp/gif) | ~260 | **~150 MB** |
| Other (json/ts/pdf/…) | ~44 | ~20 MB |
| **Total (N)** | **1179 files, 158 dirs** | **~170 MB** |
| `.git` history | | ~570 MB |

So `add_all(["*"])` walks **1179 files across 158 directories every sync** — and
~260 of them are images that a text edit never changes. That does two things the
toy-repo baseline hides:

1. **The walk term is large and paid on every sync** — 1179 `stat`s + 158 dir
   reads over SPI, for a one-line note change. This is the O(N) cost the curve
   above predicts, at N ≈ 1179 rather than N ≈ 2.
2. **Re-hash risk.** libgit2 decides a file is unchanged from `stat` metadata
   (mtime/size). FAT's coarse mtime and lack of a stable inode can make entries
   look racy, forcing a content re-hash. If even a slice of the ~150 MB of images
   gets re-hashed over a 10 MHz SPI bus, the commit balloons far past 4 s. The
   `walk` timer will show it; explicit-path staging sidesteps it entirely by never
   visiting the images.

## Measurement (2026-07-12, toy `notes.md` tree, N ≈ 2)

Split from two back-to-back `:sync`es on the small test repo (commits `95ac56ef`
cold, `ab260bde` warm), via the `commit split —` log lines:

| Sub-phase | Kind | Cold (ms) | Warm (ms) |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `walk(add_all+update_all)` | scan (O(N)) + likely 1 blob write | 1402 | 1456 |
| `index.write` | FAT write | 204 | 204 |
| `write_tree` | **1 tree object → FAT** | 710 | 715 |
| `parent-load` | FAT read | 102 | 105 |
| `commit-obj` | **1 commit object + ref → FAT** | 914 | 924 |
| **commit total** | | **3332** | **3404** |

### It is not the card — it's libgit2 (`sd_bench`, 2026-07-12)

My first read of the table was "a loose-object write to this SD card costs
~700–900 ms." **That was wrong.** `sd_bench` (`firmware/src/bin/sd_bench.rs`) times
the raw FAT primitives on the same card at the same 10 MHz:

| Raw FAT op (200-byte payload) | p50 |
| --- | ---: |
| create + write + close | 21.7 ms |
| rename | 12.8 ms |
| stat (hit / miss) | ~5 ms |
| remove | 14.9 ms |
| **loose-object composite** (stat + create + write + rename) | **86 ms** |

The card does a *complete* loose-object write in **~86 ms**. Yet `write_tree`
(one tree object) took **710 ms** and `commit-obj` **914 ms** — an **~8× gap that
is pure libgit2 overhead, not FAT I/O.** So the earlier "object-write floor / SD
write amplification / better card / SPI-clock" framing is refuted: **the SD card is
not the bottleneck.** fsync is still confirmed off; the extra ~600 ms/op is CPU or
repeated `.git` I/O *inside* libgit2 (candidates: ODB refresh scanning
`objects/`, the treebuilder's per-entry `git_odb_exists`, ref-lock + reflog writes,
config/attributes re-reads). `git_bench` (`firmware/src/bin/git_bench.rs`) localizes
it — see below.

### It's the pack, read through an un-caching emulated mmap (`git_bench`, 2026-07-12)

`git_bench` times the git2 primitives in isolation on `/sd/repo` (git ops on the
same 96 KB thread the real service uses — the main-task stack overflows on
`index.write`, which is itself the reason the service has a dedicated thread):

| git2 op | p50 | note |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Repository::open` | 100 ms | one-time |
| `odb.write(blob)` (unique) | **45 ms** | writes a fresh object; touches no existing object |
| `repo.index()` open | ~0 ms | cached |
| `index.write()` | 376 ms | index + `index.lock` rename + tree-cache |
| `write_tree` [unchanged] | ~0 ms | tree exists → freshen-skips the write |
| **`write_tree` [changed]** | **1136 ms** | writes ONE 45 ms object |
| **`commit(None)` orphan obj** | **563 ms** | writes ONE 45 ms object, no ref/reflog |

Writing a fresh object is 45 ms; the ops that wrap one are 8–25×. The cause, from
the vendored source: `git_odb_write` calls `git_odb__freshen` (odb.c:1011), which
on a not-found object runs **`git_odb_refresh`** (re-reads the pack dir + reloads
pack indexes), and existence checks (`freshen(tree)` in `commit.c:169`, base-object
lookups in `write_tree`) hit the **pack**. Pack access goes through our
`p_mmap` (`esp_map.c`), which **`malloc`s and `read()`s the mapped range from the
card on every call — no cache** — with a 32 MB window on this 32-bit target. So
each write re-reads pack bytes from SD; `odb.write` of a fresh blob is 45 ms only
because it touches no packed object.

**This scales with pack size.** The toy repo's pack is tiny; the real
`jcalixte/notes` clone has a **570 MB pack**, and provisioning rsyncs a full clone
onto the card — so a real-repo commit has **never been benchmarked** and, on this
mechanism, will be far worse than the ~3.3 s toy number. That is the single biggest
open risk in sync.

### Real-repo run (2026-07-12, `jcalixte/notes`, 570 MB pack) — the index is the wrong primitive

`git_bench` was finally run against a full clone of the real repo (1179 files, 158
dirs, 570 MB pack). It settles the design: **any index-based commit is O(N_tree)
and does not fit this device.** Two independent walls:

| op | result | reading |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Repository::open` | 88 ms | fine |
| odb open (implicit) | ~6 s cold | maps the 1.7 MB pack `.idx` once (16 miss / 1790 KB) |
| `odb.write(blob)` | **142 ms** p50 | the mmap cache win **holds** (was 862 ms uncached) ✅ |
| `repo.index()` load (1179 entries) | 514 ms max | the on-disk index we were trying to avoid |
| `index.write()` | **min 360 ms / p50 12.8 s / max 611 s** | ⚠️ hangs — see root cause |
| **seed `read_tree(HEAD)` (cold, 1×)** | **~77 s** | ⚠️ reads all ~158 tree objects, 22.7 MB of pack windows |
| `Index::new + read_tree` (warm) | 447 ms p50 | windows still mapped → pure CPU |
| **index-free `stage→tree`** | **💥 crash** | `zlib (5)`: `deflateInit` failed, **508 KB heap left** |

**Wall 1 — `index.write()` hashes the whole working tree (up to 611 s).**
`git_index_write` unconditionally calls `truncate_racily_clean` (index.c:822),
which runs `git_diff_index_to_workdir` over **every** entry flagged "racy" and
re-hashes its file. On a fresh FAT clone the mtime granularity is 2 s and
`index.stamp.mtime <= entry.mtime` for ~all 1179 entries (index.h:117), so the
whole tree looks racy → it re-hashes ~170 MB (mostly the 150 MB of images) over
10 MHz SPI. The 611 s → 12.8 s → 360 ms decay across three iterations is the
signature: each write bumps the index mtime, shrinking the racy set. **Implication:
the shipping `stage_and_commit` calls `index.write()`, so `:sync` on the real repo
effectively bricks on the first commit** — the user sees a 10-minute freeze,
resets, the index mtime never advances, and it re-hashes forever. The real repo has
almost certainly never completed a sync on device (only the toy `typoena-test` has).

**Wall 2 — the index-free path is still O(N_tree), and the mmap cache OOMs.**
Skipping `index.write()` entirely (fresh `Index::new()`, stamp = 0, so
`truncate_racily_clean` can never fire) removes Wall 1. But to seed the in-memory
index, `read_tree(HEAD)` materialises all 1179 entries and reads every tree object
from the 570 MB pack — **77 s cold** (447 ms only once the windows are resident).
`write_tree_to` is O(changed), but you pay O(N_tree) to build the cache it needs, so
the index-free path only trades a 611 s hash for a 77 s tree-read. Worse, that
`read_tree` drove the `esp_map.c` cache to **7.4 MB resident** — past its own 4 MB
soft cap — which left 508 KB of heap and made `repo.blob()`'s zlib `deflateInit`
fail. **The one write we cannot skip crashed.** Root cause of the OOM: our cache
holds pack windows *after* libgit2 `p_munmap`s them (refcount 0, freed only lazily
on the next `p_mmap`), which **defeats `GIT_OPT_SET_MWINDOW_MAPPED_LIMIT`** —
libgit2 thinks it released the memory; we didn't.

**Conclusion — use an O(depth) TreeBuilder walk.** "Replace K files in a 1179-file
tree" should touch `O(depth × K)` objects, not `O(N_tree)`. Walk HEAD's tree down
the edited path (`tree.get_name`/`get_path` → read ~depth subtree objects), then
rebuild bottom-up with `repo.treebuilder(Some(&subtree))` → `insert`/`remove` →
`write()`, and `commit` the new root. That never materialises the 1179 entries,
never re-hashes anything, never visits the 150 MB of images, reads only a handful
of tree windows (so the cache stays small and zlib keeps its heap), and — crucially
— **carries the image entries forward untouched from HEAD's tree, so the device
does not even need the images in its working tree.** The `esp_map.c` cache still
needs an evict-on-`munmap` fix (drop the cap, free past a low-water mark) so it can
never again starve a downstream `git__malloc`, but with the TreeBuilder walk the
pressure it was under largely disappears.

### Splice bench (2026-07-12, second real-repo run) — the walk is right, the loose-object write is the new wall

The O(depth) splice op was added to `git_bench` (1 blob + 3 tree writes onto the
depth-3 path `.claude/commands/bsky.md`, run FIRST so its first iteration is
cold; the index ops moved last so their OOM can't cost the new data — it did
crash again, after everything was logged):

| op | result | reading |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `splice stage→tree` (1 blob + 3 trees) | **6.5 s p50, warm ≈ cold** | O(depth) confirmed — cost is 4 loose writes × ~1.6 s |
| `commit(None)` orphan obj | 1.7 s p50 | one more loose write |
| `odb.write(blob)` | **1.5 s p50** | ⚠️ was 142 ms in the previous run |
| `repo.index()` load | 524 ms max | matches previous run |
| seed `read_tree(HEAD)` cold (now timed) | 81.6 s | reproduces the 77 s |
| `index-free stage→tree` | 💥 crash, 508 KB heap | reproduces the zlib OOM exactly |

Three readings:

1. **The splice mechanism is validated as a mechanism.** Pack reads stayed flat
   (~40 KB per write; 6.4 MB heap free through splice + commit + odb.write), so
   it really is O(depth) and it cannot OOM. The 6.5 s is not tree-walk cost.
2. **The wall moved to the loose-object write: ~1.5 s each, ×4 per splice.**
   The isolated `odb.write(blob)` — one tiny orphan blob — took 1.5 s where the
   raw FAT composite is 86 ms. Projected full commit (splice 6.5 s + commit-obj
   1.7 s + ref/reflog update) ≈ **8–9 s**: enormously better than 611 s, still
   far off the bar.
3. **The mmap cache scored 0 hits over the entire run** — the documented
   862→142 ms `odb.write` win did **not reproduce** (same `esp_map.c`, same
   card). Either the earlier run's conditions differed (orphan-object
   population? FAT allocation state?) or the win was misattributed. Whatever the
   1.5 s is, it is *not* SD data volume: each write moves ~40 KB read + ~1 KB
   written.

### ROOT CAUSE FOUND (2026-07-12, `sd_bench` seek op): FatFS lseek walks the cluster chain

Two `sd_bench` re-runs on the ~740 MB-full card settled it:

1. **Free-cluster-scan hypothesis: refuted.** Raw FAT write ops are unchanged on
   the full card — loose-object composite **77 ms p50** (was 86 ms), create
   20 ms, rename 10 ms. The card is exonerated a second time.
2. **Long seeks are the cost.** A new op opens the repo's largest packfile
   (263 MB — the "570 MB pack" was actually the whole `.git`) read-only and does
   seek+read(4 KB): **@offset 0 = 5.8 ms; @end = 198.7 ms** — dead constant
   across 20 iters. Without `CONFIG_FATFS_USE_FASTSEEK`, FatFS resolves lseek by
   walking the file's FAT cluster chain over SPI: forward from the current
   position, **from the chain head on any backward seek**. 263 MB ≈ 16.8k
   clusters ≈ ~67 KB of FAT reads ≈ ~190 ms per long walk.

**Why FAT behaves this way:** FAT has no extent map or inode — a file is a
singly-linked list of clusters, and the only way to find "byte 260,000,000" is
to follow that list entry by entry through the allocation table. FatFS walks
forward from the current position when it can, but a backward seek restarts
from the chain head ([FatFS `f_lseek` docs, elm-chan.org](http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/doc/lseek.html)).
The fast-seek feature fixes exactly this: a pre-computed **cluster link map
table (CLMT)** per file object, "(fragments + 1) × 2" words, after which "no
FAT access is occured in subsequent f_read/f_write/f_lseek" (same page). On
esp-idf it's `CONFIG_FATFS_USE_FASTSEEK` — the official docs recommend it "for
read-heavy workloads with long backward seeks" and note it does not apply to
files opened in write mode
([ESP-IDF FatFS docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/fatfs.html)).

The budget closes: each loose write does ~8–10 small (~4 KB) `p_mmap`s (freshen
→ trailer/idx probes) interleaved with low-offset reads, so ~8 of them pay a
fresh ~190 ms walk → **~1.5 s per object**. It also explains everything the
cache couldn't: warm ≈ cold (the walk is paid inside `lseek` before any data
moves, and the maps are below the 64 KB cache floor), the 142 ms vs 1.5 s
run-1/run-2 discrepancy (run 1's `odb.write` bench ran first and hammered only
the trailer — the file position stayed there, so its seeks were forward/no-ops),
and a large slice of the 81.6 s `read_tree` (133 windows × backward seeks ≈ 25 s
of walking on top of the 25 MB of data).

**Fix (config, not code): `CONFIG_FATFS_USE_FASTSEEK=y` +
`CONFIG_FATFS_FAST_SEEK_BUFFER_SIZE=256`** (landed in `sdkconfig.defaults`
2026-07-12). Fast seek builds an in-memory cluster-link map per read-mode file —
exactly how the pack is opened — making lseek O(1); write-mode files fall back
to the walk transparently. 256 words = 1 KB per open read-only file, covering
~127 fragments (default 64 covers ~31; a fragmented pack would silently fall
back to slow seeks, so the headroom matters).

**A/B measured (same evening): a 2.3× partial win, not a full one.**

| op | fast-seek off | fast-seek on |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `splice stage→tree` | 6.5 s | **2.81 s** |
| `odb.write(blob)` | 1.5 s | **416 ms** |
| `commit(None)` | 1.7 s | **1.72 s — unchanged** |

`odb.write` dropped by almost exactly the ~6 chain walks the model predicted —
the seek theory holds — but two residuals remain: **~400 ms per loose write**
(vs the 77 ms raw-FAT floor) and **`commit(None)`'s ~1.3 s premium over a plain
write, which was never seek-bound at all**. Prime suspect for the commit
premium: strict object creation makes `git_commit_create` validate its parent +
tree OIDs with pack header resolves, and `git_treebuilder_insert` does the same
per inserted entry — `git_bench` grew `odb.read_header(packed)` /
`odb.exists(missing)` probes and strict-off re-benches to test it.

### Second localization round (2026-07-12, run 3b + sd_bench re-run)

**Fast-seek verified on the metal:** re-running the sd_bench seek op with
`CONFIG_FATFS_USE_FASTSEEK=y` dropped `pack seek+read 4KB @end` from
**198.7 ms → 20.4 ms** (the CLMT fits the pack in the 256-word buffer — the
pack is not too fragmented). A far seek is now ~15 ms, i.e. effectively fixed.

**The strict-creation theory is refuted; the probes found the real unit cost:**

| op | p50 | reading |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `odb.read_header(packed)` | **470 ms** | ONE pack header resolve costs ~½ s |
| `odb.exists(missing)` | **968 ms** (±0.1 ms) | miss path (scan → refresh → rescan) ≈ 2× |
| `commit(None)` strict OFF | 1.80 s | vs 1.93 s strict on — validation is NOT the premium |
| `splice` strict OFF | 5.7 s | noise-worse; also not validation |

The ±0.1 ms constancy of `exists(missing)` = a fixed, deterministic SD-op
sequence. The map counters identify it: **~7–8 small (~4 KB) `p_mmap` reads per
op** — pack trailer probes, idx fanout reads and delta-base windows, repeated
at the *same offsets* on every freshen/refresh. Post-fast-seek those cost
~20 ms each (~150 ms/op); the rest of `read_header`'s 470 ms is CPU-side
delta-chain inflation on the 160 MHz core plus repeated re-reads. Two other
observations from run 3b: the loose-object orphan population from bench runs
is creeping costs upward (splice 2.81 s → 3.21 s between consecutive
fast-seek runs — a re-provision resets it), and the mmap cache STILL scored 0
hits — because its 64 KB map-length floor excluded exactly these hot small
maps.

**Fix built (esp_map.c v2):** cache admission re-keyed from
map length to **file size ≥ 1 MB** — the pack/idx's small repeated windows now
cache (RAM hits after first touch) while small mutable working-tree files stay
excluded — plus **evict-on-`p_munmap` down to a 2 MB low-water mark**, fixing
the 7.4 MB OOM from the first real-repo run (released windows are actually
returned to `git__malloc`, so `MWINDOW_MAPPED_LIMIT` stays honest). Expected:
`read_header` collapses toward CPU-only, `odb.write` toward ~150–250 ms,
splice at or under the sub-second bar, and no end-of-run zlib OOM.

### Final bench (run 4, esp_map v2) — memory fix works, cache theory dead, bar failed

Run 4 (2026-07-12 evening, same card state as run 3b plus its orphans):

| op | run 3b (fast-seek) | run 4 (+ esp_map v2) |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `splice stage→tree` (cold, first op) | 2.81 s | **2.83 s — unchanged** |
| `splice` again (warm, strict-off phase) | 3.21 s | 1.95 s |
| `commit(None)` | 1.72 s | 713 ms |
| `odb.write(blob)` | 416 ms | 366 ms |
| `odb.read_header(packed)` | 470 ms | 412 ms |
| `odb.exists(missing)` | 968 ms | 852 ms |
| mmap-cache hits | 0 | **0** (313 misses) |
| cache resident / heap free | grew to 7.4 MB → zlib OOM | **1833 KB flat / 6.4 MB free all run** |

Three findings:

1. **The memory discipline is verified.** Resident sits at 1833 KB through
   every phase (under the 2 MB low-water, so nothing is being churned) and
   heap never drops below 6.2 MB. The one uncaptured datum is the index-free
   `read_tree` tail (the section that OOM'd runs 1–3) — the monitor was cut
   before it ran. Not blocking: the shipping splice path never calls
   `read_tree`; the tail would only re-confirm eviction under burst.
2. **The repeated-small-window theory is REFUTED — theory #3 down** (after
   strict-creation and free-cluster-scan). v2 demonstrably admits and retains
   the small maps now — the 1833 KB resident *is* them, held below low-water so
   nothing is evicted before reuse — and still scored 0 hits in 313 misses.
   So the ~8 small reads per loose write hit **unique (offset, len) every
   time**: `mwindow` was already absorbing any true repetition above `p_mmap`,
   and what reaches the emulation layer is distinct data (different objects,
   different delta bases). A window cache cannot help. The residual
   ~360 ms/loose-write ≈ 8 distinct small SD round-trips × ~45 ms each
   (post-fast-seek) — I/O count, not I/O size or seek cost.
3. **Within-run drift cuts both ways, so cross-run tables are mushy.** In this
   single run `commit(None)` degraded 713 ms → 1.79 s between the early and
   late (strict-off) phases, while splice *improved* 2.83 → 1.95 s. Two
   competing effects: first-touch warm-up fading (CLMT build, first pack
   reads — helps later ops) and orphan loose objects accumulating in
   `.git/objects/xx/` slowing every freshen existence check (FAT directory
   lookups are linear scans — hurts later ops). Steady-state on a clean
   objects dir ≈ **~2 s per splice+commit**.

**Run 5 (confirmation, cache removed entirely):** esp_map.c stripped back to
plain malloc-read/free-at-munmap (stats counters kept). Read pattern
**byte-identical** to run 4 at every checkpoint (118 maps / 2314 KB after
splice, 148/2434, 163/2494, 208/2674) — except the strict-off phase did **15
fewer reads (~60 KB)** than v2: the low-water eviction had been kicking out
buffers mwindow still wanted, forcing re-reads. The cache was marginally
worse than nothing. Warm splice identical (1953 vs 1949 ms); the cold-op
+10–15 % drift (splice 2.83 → 3.26 s) is the known orphan-creep signature,
not the removal. Run 5 also reframes run 4's "resident": **1854 KB `live` is
mwindow's open-window working set** (pinned mappings under the bench's 4 MB
mapped limit), not retained cache buffers — the cache had been retaining
essentially nothing. Removal CONFIRMED free; simpler emulation ships.

**Verdict: the sub-second bar FAILED — wire the splice in anyway.** The bar
was aspirational; measured reality is ~2–2.8 s to commit on the real
263 MB-pack repo versus 611 s (or a hard OOM) for every alternative benched.
That puts a full real-repo `:sync` at roughly **9–10 s cold**, which ships.
The remaining ~2 s has survived four localization rounds; the next suspect —
FAT *directory-op* cost in the freshen/refresh path (open/stat/rename by path
walk FAT directories linearly; consistent with the orphan-creep signal) — is
one instrumentation pass for later (log each `p_mmap` miss + bench dir ops in
`sd_bench`), not a prerequisite for the plumbing.

**Run 6 (2026-07-14, `sd_bench` directory-entry scaling): the residual is
CONVICTED — FAT linear directory scans.** Two independent signals, both from
the real card at 10 MHz:

1. `stat` on a **missing** name (the freshen probe's shape — no early exit,
   the whole parent is scanned) is linear in sibling count: 4.7 ms at 8
   siblings → 12.8 ms at 64 → 28.9 ms at 256 ≈ **~0.1 ms per directory entry
   per scan**. (`stat` on a *present* name plateaued at ~8 ms, but that's the
   bench's shape — 20 iterations only ever touch the first 20 entries, which
   sit early in the scan.)
2. The **loose-object composite** (freshen stat-miss + temp create + write +
   remove + rename, libgit2's exact sequence) scales the same way and lands
   exactly on the field number: mean 95.5 ms at 8 siblings → 163.6 at 64 →
   **366.8 ms (p50 402.9) at 256** — the observed ~360–400 ms/loose-write,
   reproduced from primitives. The multiplier over a single scan is the
   sequence's ~5–6 full parent scans (every miss probe, free-slot search, and
   rename-target check walks all N entries; 38-hex LFN names burn several
   entries each, steepening the slope).

The real repo's `.git/objects/` holds up to 256 two-hex fan-out dirs plus
`pack/`/`info/`, so every path resolution under it pays the ~256-entry scan —
that's the whole residual. It composes with the earlier finding that the
splice does **0 pack reads** during these writes (run-1 `p_mmap` counters):
nothing here is data I/O. Consequences: (a) the cost is *bounded* — ~0.4 s ×
loose objects per commit (typically ≤ 5) ≈ ≤ 2 s, already inside the shipped
splice numbers, so nothing burns; (b) the only real levers are *fewer
path-resolutions per object* (libgit2 surgery) or *not writing loose objects
at all* (commit straight into a small pack) — both out of scope until a
future perf pass; (c) orphan-creep is now mechanically explained: each
leftover loose object adds entries to a fan-out dir and slows every later
scan of it.

### The walk is ~1.4 s even at N ≈ 2

Mostly fixed cost — the worktree-diff setup and the second (`update_all`) pass —
not per-file `stat` (one raw `stat` is ~5 ms, so N ≈ 2 can't be the 1.4 s). The
O(N) slope only bites on the real `jcalixte/notes` clone (N ≈ 1179), which this run
did **not** exercise. That slope is still unmeasured.

For orientation: `publish(commit+push)` was 9846 ms cold, so the **network half is
~6.5 s** — still the biggest single block of a warm sync (10.1 s total), a separate
floor ([`../notes/sync-latency.md`](../notes/sync-latency.md)).

## The verdict

The real-repo run (above) overturned the earlier ranking. Both index strategies
are O(N_tree) and fail on the 570 MB-pack clone, and the repo cannot be shrunk. The
work, ranked:

1. **Rewrite the commit as an O(depth) TreeBuilder walk (the fix — build this).**
   Rebuild only the edited path's ancestor subtree chain onto HEAD's tree; never
   materialise the 1179-entry index, never `index.write()`, never `read_tree` the
   whole tree. This is the ONLY mechanism that fits: O(depth × dirty) reads/writes,
   flat in repo size, small heap, images carried forward untouched. Replaces
   `stage_and_commit`'s `add_all`/`update_all`/`index.write`/`write_tree`. Needs the
   editor's dirty set (+ deleted set) plumbed to the git service — the editor
   already knows both. **Benched to completion 2026-07-12: 6.5 s → 2.8 s cold /
   ~2 s steady-state after the fast-seek fix (run 4). The sub-second bar failed
   but the block is lifted — wire it in** (see the final-bench section above:
   the residual is unique small SD round-trips, not something a cache or seek
   fix can remove).
2. **Fix the `esp_map.c` cache so it can't OOM — RESOLVED BY REMOVAL (run 5).**
   The cache never scored a hit in four instrumented real-repo runs
   (`mwindow` absorbs true repetition above `p_mmap`; only new ranges reach
   the emulation), and the 7.4 MB OOM it was patched to avoid was caused by
   the cache itself holding buffers past `p_munmap`. esp_map.c is now the
   plain malloc-read/free-at-munmap emulation: honest with
   `MWINDOW_MAPPED_LIMIT` by construction, ~120 lines lighter, and run 5
   confirmed removal is I/O-neutral (even 15 reads *better* than v2, whose
   low-water eviction fought mwindow). Stats counters kept to spot any future
   workload that does repeat ranges.
3. **Retired: `add_all`/explicit-path *index* staging.** Explicit-path `add_path`
   still goes through the index and `index.write` → `truncate_racily_clean`, so it
   hits Wall 1 just the same. The TreeBuilder walk supersedes it entirely; the
   "explicit-path staging" idea survives only as "the editor's dirty set feeds the
   walk."
4. **Retired: SD clock / better card.** The card does a full object write in
   ~86 ms; raw I/O is not the bottleneck. Do not spend the PCB's 20 MHz budget
   expecting a commit-latency win.
5. **Kept: the mmap cache + mwindow tuning** (`GIT_OPT_SET_MWINDOW_*`, 256 KB
   window / 4 MB mapped limit). It fixed `odb.write` and the push read path; #2 just
   makes it well-behaved under memory pressure.

**Recommendation:** build #1 (the O(depth) TreeBuilder walk) — #2 resolved
itself by removal. The concrete plumbing plan (exact call sites, dirty-set
threading, FD budget) is the
[next section](#the-fix--wiring-the-odepth-splice-into-the-firmware).

### The splice walk

Rebuild only the edited file's ancestor subtree chain onto HEAD's tree. Never
materialise the 1179-entry index; never `index.write()`; never `read_tree` the
whole tree. Cost is O(depth × dirty_files), flat in repo size, tiny heap, and it
carries every unchanged entry (all 260 images, the other 1176 files) forward
untouched — which means **the device doesn't even need the images in its
working tree.**

Shipped as `git_sync::splice` (git2 0.20: `Repository::treebuilder(Option<&Tree>)`
+ `TreeBuilder::{insert,remove,write}`). Signature:

```rust
fn splice(repo: &Repository, base: Option<&Tree>, path: &[&str], blob: Option<Oid>) -> Result<Oid>
```

`Some(blob)` inserts/replaces, `None` removes; `base: None` synthesizes a
missing intermediate directory on the way down, and a directory emptied by a
remove is pruned on the way up (the empty tree is never re-inserted).
`stage_and_commit` folds every dirty path through it (threading the running
root tree), then `commit(Some("HEAD"), …)` exactly as before — the
`tree unchanged → nothing to publish` check and the `commit split —` timing
log survive. The benched reference is `git_bench`'s `splice stage→tree` op.

### `firmware/src/git_sync.rs` — how it landed

- **mwindow options set at service start** (top of `run_git_service`, before
  any `Repository::open`): `set_mwindow_size(256 KB)` +
  `set_mwindow_mapped_limit(4 MB)`. Without them the 32-bit defaults (32 MB
  window / 256 MB mapped limit, mwindow.c:16) would `git__malloc` a 32 MB
  window on the first pack access and die on the 8 MB PSRAM heap. Run 5
  sharpened the stakes: the ~1.85 MB bench "resident" **is** mwindow's live
  open-window set, so these opts are the only thing bounding it.
- `stage_and_commit(repo, paths)` is the splice walk; `add_all`/`update_all`/
  `index.write`/`write_tree` are gone. **The request carries one path set, not
  `{changed, deleted}`:** the working tree is the source of truth, so at commit
  time a recorded path that exists on the card is spliced in from disk and a
  missing one is spliced out. An unchanged path is a no-op — over-reporting is
  free, which is what makes the retry/journal semantics below simple.
- **Stranded-commit recovery (new):** when the splice yields the parent's tree
  (nothing to commit), the service now compares HEAD against
  `refs/remotes/origin/<branch>` and still pushes if origin lacks HEAD — a
  previous cycle that committed and then failed mid-push used to strand that
  commit forever (the old path reported "up to date" and never retried).
- **Radio-free up-to-date (new):** an empty dirty set + origin already at HEAD
  short-circuits before Wi-Fi even comes up — `:sync` with nothing to do
  answers in ~150 ms instead of a Wi-Fi/TLS round.
- `reconcile_onto_origin` now `ResetType::Soft` (ref move only) — there is no
  index to reset, and a Mixed reset's index write is exactly the racy-clean
  wall the splice avoids. Side win: a remote-only added file is now *carried*
  by the replay (origin's tree is the splice base) where the old `add --all`
  replay dropped it.
- The macOS-cruft filter (`skip_macos_cruft`) is gone with the walk — the
  splice only touches paths the editor recorded, so `._*`/`.DS_Store` can't
  sneak in the way they once did (07d87772, the Spike-14-era lesson).
- **Deliberate behavior change (now in effect):** only paths the editor
  saved/deleted are ever committed. Files changed on the card outside the
  editor (card mounted on a Mac) were swept in by `add_all` before; they will
  now never be committed, and the working tree will show a permanent diff
  against HEAD if inspected on a desktop. Correct for the appliance; recorded
  here so it reads as intent, not accident.

### Dirty-set source — `firmware/src/persistence.rs` + `main.rs` (how it landed)

- `Storage` owns the record: `save_path`/`delete_path` note their repo-relative
  path in a `RefCell<Dirty>` (paths outside `/sd/repo` are skipped), and the
  set is **journaled to `/sd/.typoena-dirty`** — atomic write, rewritten only
  when the set actually grows. Without the journal a power pull would strand
  every file saved-but-not-published that session: nothing walks the tree
  anymore, so an unrecorded change would never reach the remote. The journal
  is loaded at mount and its paths ride the next `:sync`.
- Lifecycle: `take_dirty()` snapshots pending → in-flight for one publish
  (journal keeps carrying the union); the outcome settles it —
  `publish_succeeded()` forgets the snapshot and shrinks the journal,
  `publish_failed()` returns it to pending for the next `:sync`. A save landing
  *while* a publish runs re-enters pending and rides the next one. Recording
  happens *before* the file write, so a crash between the two only
  over-approximates (a no-op splice), never under-records.
- `Effect::Publish` in `main.rs` sends `PublishRequest { paths: take_dirty() }`;
  the outcome handler in the idle branch calls the matching settle method.
- **FD budget:** a git build now mounts `Storage::mount_for_git()` (16 FDs) in
  `boot_storage` — libgit2 keeps the pack + `.idx` descriptors open and opens
  loose objects on top, which overruns the editor's 4-FD budget. The light
  build keeps the editor's own budget.

### `esp_map.c` — nothing left to do

The handoff's third work item (an evict-on-`p_munmap` cache fix) is superseded:
run 5 removed the cache outright and `esp_map.c` is already the plain
malloc-read/free-at-munmap emulation (see verdict item 2). One surviving
operational note: editing `components/libgit2/*.c` won't rebuild via plain
`cargo build` — first
`rm -rf firmware/target/xtensa-esp32s3-espidf/release/.fingerprint/esp-idf-sys-*`
(the `esp-idf-component-rebuild` lesson).

### How to bench / flash

`git_bench.rs` runs git ops on the 96 KB `GIT_STACK` thread (the main task stack
overflows on these ops — that's why the real service has a dedicated thread). It's
Rust-only, so a plain rebuild picks it up (no fingerprint dance unless you also
touched `esp_map.c`).

```
just flash-gitbench
# = . ~/export-esp.sh && LIBGIT2_SRC=<repo>/firmware/components/libgit2/vendor \
#     LIBGIT2_NO_VENDOR=1 PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1 \
#     PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR=<repo>/firmware/pkgconfig \
#     cargo run --release --bin git_bench --features git
```

Bench on the **real repo** clone (`/sd/repo` = full `jcalixte/notes`), not the
toy — the toy pack understates everything by ~2 orders of magnitude.

### Still open (none block the plumbing)

- ~~The residual ~360 ms/loose-write~~ **CLOSED 2026-07-14** — convicted as
  FAT linear directory scans of the ~256-entry `.git/objects/` fan-out (run 6
  above): `sd_bench`'s dir-entry-scaling section reproduced the field number
  from primitives (loose composite p50 402.9 ms at 256 siblings). Bounded and
  accepted; the levers (fewer path resolutions, or pack-not-loose commits)
  are a future perf pass.
- Ref/reflog-update cost on the real repo — the bench's `commit(None)` writes
  no ref, so the shipping commit's last leg is unmeasured.
- The push's ~6.5 s network floor
  ([`../notes/sync-latency.md`](../notes/sync-latency.md)) — a separate curve.

## Adjacent lever: should the images be on the card at all?

Explicit-path staging makes the walk skip the images, but they still cost 150 MB
of SD space, inflate the 570 MB clone, and slow provisioning + the pull-before-push
paths. Whether the device should carry image blobs at all — vs. markdown-only, or
Git-LFS-style pointers — is a separate decision tracked in
[`../notes/git-sync-images-and-repo-size.md`](../notes/git-sync-images-and-repo-size.md).
That lever shrinks N and the clone; this one stops the walk from paying for N. They
compose.

## What this does *not* touch

The network half of `:sync` (TLS handshake + push round-trips, ~6.5 s of the warm
path) is a separate floor covered in [`sync-latency.md`](../notes/sync-latency.md);
this curve is only about the local commit. Radio *frequency* (how often we pay any
sync at all) is [`wifi-auto-sync.md`](wifi-auto-sync.md).
