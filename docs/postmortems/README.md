# Postmortems

> Bench + bring-up debugging write-ups: what broke, how we found the root cause,
> and the decisions that came out of it. One file per incident, named
> `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md`. These capture *why* a spike stalled or a design turned
> — the kind of context that's expensive to reconstruct later.
