The question that started this: **Typoena** keeps a persistent clone of my
notes repo (`github.com/jcalixte/notes`) on its SD card and fast-forwards it
on every `:gs`. The most likely first failure is a cold clone that's too
big — so the instinct was "clone the least data possible; ignore
`node_modules`; maybe strip the media." That instinct is mostly wrong, for
reasons worth writing down before anyone force-pushes a rewritten history.

## The measured reality

| Metric (target repo, measured 2026-07-07) | Value                                |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Working tree                              | 3.9 GB (dominated by `node_modules`) |
| `.git` (what a clone actually transfers)  | **566 MB**                           |
| Commits / objects                         | 13,852 / 63,252                      |
| Depth-1 snapshot (HEAD tree + blobs)      | **154.7 MB**                         |
| — of which markdown (the notes)           | **1.4 MB**                           |
| — of which media (png/jpg/pdf/gif/bmp)    | **153 MB**                           |
| Media across _all_ history (dedup)        | 566 MB (715 PNG objects = 463 MB)    |

Two early assumptions corrected:

- **`node_modules` is a non-issue.** It's gitignored and was never committed,
  so a clone never touches it. There's nothing to filter. The 3.9 GB working
  tree is a red herring; a clone transfers the 566 MB `.git`.
- **The risk isn't stack overflow, it's transfer size.** 566 MB over Wi-Fi +
  mbedTLS to an SPI SD card, with no resume, is 30+ minutes and one dropout
  away from failure. Stack/memory pressure is a symptom of asking the device
  to cold-clone half a gigabyte.

## Why shrinking is off the table

The clean fix for "device only needs 1.4 MB of text" would be a blobless
partial clone (`--filter=blob:none`) — **libgit2 does not support it**. The
fallbacks are LFS migration, a filter-repo history purge, or `git rm` of media
at HEAD. All three remove the image _blobs_ from what a git client sees.

That breaks **remanso**, the web app that reads the same repo. remanso is a
frontend with no server-side git; it displays a note image by reading the
image straight out of git as a blob and inlining it as a data URI
(`useImages.hook.ts` + `repo.ts`):

1. Markdown `<img src="relative/path.png">`
2. resolve path → find the file's `sha` in the GitHub tree
3. `GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/git/blobs/{sha}` → **base64 of the git blob**
4. `img.src = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + thatContent`

The image _is_ the git blob. GitHub's Git Blobs / Trees / Contents APIs do
**not** resolve LFS (only `media.githubusercontent.com` does, which remanso
doesn't use). So after an LFS migration those endpoints return the ~130-byte
**pointer text**, remanso wraps it in `data:image/jpeg;base64,…`, and every
image renders broken. Uploads break too: remanso writes images via
`PUT /contents`, which ignores `.gitattributes`/LFS and commits a plain blob.

And it's not specific to LFS — `git rm` at HEAD or a filter-repo purge remove
the blobs from the tree, so remanso can't find them either. **Any approach
that takes the images out of the git repo breaks remanso**, because those
150 MB are load-bearing infrastructure for the web app, not offloadable bloat.

| Consumer                       | How it reads images                            | If we shrink the repo                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Typoena (libgit2)              | doesn't render images; needs valid git objects | fine — would get tiny pointers                                                |
| remanso (Blobs API → data URI) | reads image bytes straight out of git          | **broken** — pointer/missing bytes render as a dead image; uploads bypass LFS |

## Decision

**Leave the notes repo untouched. Pre-seed the device SD card with a full
`git clone` from a computer.**

Repo size is only a _device_ constraint when the _device_ does the cold clone.
A laptop clones 566 MB in ~2 minutes onto the SD via a card reader; the SD has
GB to spare. The device then only ever takes the `open` + incremental
fetch/commit/push path (`open_or_clone` already splits on this). A _full_
pre-seed (not depth-1) also sidesteps the shallow-push sharp edge. remanso
keeps working, the device gets everything, and repo size stops being anyone's
problem.

Implemented in firmware/justfile as three recipes, each ejecting the card when
done so it goes straight into Typoena:

- `just init <repo-path>` — full prep of a fresh card: copies a full clone to
  the card's `repo/`, excluding everything the repo's `.gitignore` ignores (so
  `node_modules` and local secrets like `firmware/.env` never land on the card),
  then writes `/sd/typoena.conf` — Wi-Fi creds + PAT + git identity — from the
  `TW_*` vars already in `firmware/.env` (no re-typing, no prompts).
- `just load <repo-path>` — the repo copy on its own (refresh after big upstream
  changes).
- `just provision` — the config on its own (rotate the PAT / switch networks
  without re-copying the repo).

The firmware still reads those values via `env!()` today; reading
`/sd/typoena.conf` at boot is a TODO that rides with the SD wiring into
`main.rs`.

## What happens on an ongoing pull

In the single-writer model the device usually doesn't pull at all:
`fetch_and_integrate` runs only from the rejected-push arm of
`push_with_retry`, and a sole writer always fast-forwards. "Images to pull"
only arises when a **second writer** (remanso or the desktop) pushed them.
When it does, today the device fetches (downloading the image blobs) and then
hits the divergence bail (`increment B, deferred`) — no data loss, but no
integration until the merge path exists.

Once integration lands, the costs of carrying media the device never renders:

1. **Bandwidth for unusable bytes.** No partial fetch in libgit2, so a fetch
   pulls the full new image blobs. 20 MB of pasted screenshots = a 20 MB fetch
   before a one-line note can push.
2. **~2× SD storage.** Each image lives in `.git` _and_ in the working-tree
   checkout that `checkout_head(force)` writes.
3. **Memory — the real edge.** libgit2 tends to materialize a whole blob in
   RAM for checkout. History already has a 38 MB mp3 and 16 MB PNGs. Against
   **8 MB PSRAM**, a single large image arriving in a pull is a genuine OOM
   risk on checkout. Verify on hardware (push a 20 MB image from remanso, watch
   `min_free_heap`) rather than trusting a read of libgit2 internals.

**The trap:** `push()` stages with `add_all(["*"])`. A sparse checkout that
omitted images would make `add_all` see them as deleted → the device would
commit "delete all images" and push it → remanso loses every image. So with
the current staging, a full checkout is mandatory — which is what feeds costs
2 and 3.

## Fix for increment C (git module in the editor) — LANDED 2026-07-14

Both halves shipped, months apart, each by its own route:

- **Stage specific paths, not `add_all(["*"])`** — delivered by the v0.6
  splice commit (2026-07-13): the device commits exactly the dirty-journal
  paths. This is what disarmed the trap below — a working tree missing its
  images can no longer be committed as "delete all images".
- **Skip media in the pull apply** (the sparse-checkout idea, done the
  `apply_tree_diff` way, 2026-07-14): media extensions are invisible to both
  of the apply's passes — never written, never deleted, and never
  belt-hashed (hashing a stale 16 MB image would re-open the same OOM). The
  blobs still arrive in `.git` on fetch (streamed, no partial clone in
  libgit2); only the working-tree copy is skipped. `is_media_path` in
  `git_sync.rs` holds the extension list.

The accepted trade: the card's media files go stale/absent relative to HEAD,
so a computer opening the card clone sees phantom `modified`/`deleted`
images in `git status`. The card is device-owned — refresh it with
`just load`, never hand-commit from it (`git add -A` there would commit the
staleness for real and break remanso). `git checkout -- .` on a computer
restores every image from `.git` if a clean tree is ever wanted.
