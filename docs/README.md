## Decisions & specs

| Doc                                              | What's in it                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`adr.md`](adr.md)                               | Architecture Decision Records — the load-bearing technical choices and why.                                          |
| [`v0.1-mvp-product.md`](v0.1-mvp-product.md)     | v0.1 product design — boot, type one file, `Ctrl-S` to save, `Ctrl-G` to publish.                                    |
| [`v0.1-mvp-technical.md`](v0.1-mvp-technical.md) | v0.1 technical design — single Rust binary on `esp-idf-rs`, modules, threads, bring-up order.                        |
| [`macroplan.md`](macroplan.md)                   | Version-by-version plan; each release is a usable artifact, not a checkpoint.                                        |
| [`typoena-toml.md`](typoena-toml.md)             | `.typoena.toml` reference — the git-tracked editor preferences (auto-save, format-on-save, line numbers, auto-sync). |
| [`hardware.md`](hardware.md)                     | Part choices for the bench build and the rationale behind them.                                                      |

## Conventions

| Doc                        | What's in it                                                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`testing.md`](testing.md) | Where Rust tests live — unit tests in-file vs the `editor` crate's `src/tests/` behavioural submodule; how to run them. |
