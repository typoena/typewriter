## Decisions & specs

| Doc | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [`adr.md`](adr.md) | Architecture Decision Records — the load-bearing technical choices and why. |
| [`v0.1-mvp-product.md`](v0.1-mvp-product.md) | v0.1 product design — boot, type one file, `Ctrl-S` to save, `Ctrl-G` to publish. |
| [`v0.1-mvp-technical.md`](v0.1-mvp-technical.md) | v0.1 technical design — single Rust binary on `esp-idf-rs`, modules, threads, bring-up order. |
| [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) | Version-by-version plan; each release is a usable artifact, not a checkpoint. |
| [`hardware.md`](hardware.md) | Part choices for the bench build and the rationale behind them. |

## Quality method

| Doc | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [`qfd.md`](qfd.md) | Quality Function Deployment — turns user-facing requirements into technical HOWs. |
| [`quality-house.md`](quality-house.md) | The 14 WHATs × 14 HOWs House of Quality, filled in. |
| [`quality-house-empty.md`](quality-house-empty.md) | The same chassis, blank — for re-scoring from scratch. |

## Bench work

| Area | What's in it |
| --- | --- |
| [`spikes.md`](spikes.md) | Rendering & UX spikes — display/UX risks proved outside the hardware stack. |
| [`postmortems/`](postmortems/README.md) | Bring-up debugging write-ups: what broke, the root cause, and the decisions that came out of it. |
| [`notes/`](notes/README.md) | Longer-form essays on the thinking behind specific choices. |
| [`tradeoff-curves/`](tradeoff-curves/README.md) | Cost-vs-knob curves behind chosen defaults — energy, latency, memory. |
