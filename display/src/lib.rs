//! The e-paper panel's geometry and an in-memory drawable frame.

//! Split out of the hardware driver (`firmware/src/epd.rs`) so the driver and

//! consumes its raw bytes via [`Frame::bytes`] and never names the type, so
//! nothing here depends on esp-idf and the whole crate builds on the host.
