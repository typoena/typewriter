//! Application ports — the frontiers the run-loop [`Runtime`](crate::Runtime)
//! depends on.
//!
//! Each trait is a contract the application layer needs and the outer firmware
//! layer fulfils (dependency inversion: the port is owned by the consumer). The
//! esp-idf adapters live in the `firmware` crate and are injected at
//! composition; the `Runtime` names only these traits, never a concrete type,
//! so it builds and is tested on the host with in-memory doubles.
//!
//! The hardware-*device* ports ([`Screen`](hal::Screen),
//! [`Keyboard`](hal::Keyboard)) live one layer down in the `hal` crate; the
//! ports here are application/infrastructure capabilities — persistence, the
//! sync transport, the wall clock, platform lifecycle, and the file index.
//!
//! The `git` feature does not reach this layer: a light editor build injects the
//! no-op [`SyncService`]/`System` adapters, a full build the git-backed ones.
//! The `Runtime` is identical either way — the `Skipped`/`Unsupported` variants
//! below carry the difference.
