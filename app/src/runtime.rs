//! The editor run loop, lifted from `firmware/src/main.rs` into a host-testable
//! application service.
//!
//! [`Runtime`] owns the [`Editor`], the [`Panel`], the [`FocusTimer`], and every
//! injected port, and drives one iteration per [`tick`](Runtime::tick). It is a
//! faithful lift of what used to be inline in the binary's loop — the same key
//! drain, the same effect servicing, the same idle sequence and ordering — with
//! the concrete hardware calls replaced by port calls. The composition root
//! (the firmware binary) keeps only what is genuinely platform: bringing up the
//! peripherals, spawning the git and file-walk threads, and choosing which port
//! adapters to inject.
//!
//! It is generic only over the [`Screen`] (the per-pixel hot path stays static
//! dispatch, via [`Panel`]); the remaining ports are trait objects built once at
//! composition, so the struct has a single type parameter and the tests inject
//! in-memory doubles.
