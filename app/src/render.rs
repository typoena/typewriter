//! The panel render engine — the editor's e-paper refresh machinery, shared by
//! the device firmware (`main.rs`) and the no-SD `demo` bin so both drive the
//! panel through one copy of the hard-won refresh logic.
//!
//! [`Panel`] owns the [`Screen`] and the two reused framebuffers, and encapsulates
//! every paint the editor loop performs: the windowed/additive/full-area
//! decision for an edit batch ([`Panel::render_batch`]), the debounced Insert
//! caret ([`Panel::caret_if_due`]), the periodic panel-longevity full refresh
//! ([`Panel::longevity_full`]), the focus-mode rest card ([`Panel::rest_if_due`]),
//! and the failed-paint → forced-full recovery threaded through all of them.
//! Each method is a faithful lift of what used to be inline in `main.rs`'s loop,
//! so the two callers get identical panel behaviour; they differ only in the
//! *orchestration* around these calls (the device polls a git thread and a
//! palette file-walk that the demo has no equivalent of).
//!
//! The bins keep their own loop skeleton — draining the keyboard, servicing
//! [`editor::Effect`]s, sequencing the idle steps below — because those genuinely
//! diverge between a persisting device and a throwaway demo. What lives here is
//! only what is identical between them: the pixels.
